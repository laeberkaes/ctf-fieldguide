\section{Steganography}

\subsection{Extracting files from images}
One of the easiest steganography challenges is the extraction of not password secured files. There are several commands to accomplish this (\texttt{binwalk} or \texttt{steghide}). A good toolset is \emph{stego-toolkit} where you can run multiple tools with one command (\texttt{check\_jpg} or \texttt{check\_png}).
