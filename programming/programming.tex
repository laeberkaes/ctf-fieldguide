\section{Programming Challenges}

\subsection{Git history} There are several possibilities how challenges can occur in CTF's. One of the most easy ones is the flag which got removed from the repository. Mostly you get a compressed file in which is the \texttt{flag.txt}. This file is part of an repository. To see older versions of the file you can run the command \lstinline[language=bash]|git log -p|. If you are lucky enough now you will get the correct flag.
